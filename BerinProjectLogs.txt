During the first week I spent about 10-12 hours reading about the basics of the libGDX and what algorithms we can use for map generation. We discussed how to continue with the project based on our newly attained knowledge and the previous reports we wrote. 

During the second week I examined the pre-existing code written by my friends and understand in which ways libGDX was used. I started to work on the collision algorithm, and on the mirrored maze. For the collision algorithm I tried to make a simple game before moving on to our much complicated project. For the collision algorithm I decided to implement it in a way that it determines whether the direction intended to move is a brick or not so that it can be used while the orbs are put in the maze and in the update method of the MazeLevel class for the movement of the characters about after 3-4 hours of research on this. However, it worked inconsistently after implementation. I worked on debugging and I tried other ways of implementing this. Unfortunately after 2 days of work I realized the maze was printed sideways and the algorithm was in fact is working. After I changed the way it is implemented and made the collision work based on the radius of the given object it worked. We held meetings for code revision.

I worked on the LoadingScreen for about 3-5 hours but I could not manage to make it work so that it automatically loads and the game starts because when the game screen was set to another screen old one automatically disposed itself as I later realized. Sümeyye came up with the idea that we might update it to set the Screen after anywhere in the screen so we decided she finished it. I helped my teammates on debugging or when they stuck. We held meetings for long periods of time to help each other when we were stuck, so the code finished faster.
