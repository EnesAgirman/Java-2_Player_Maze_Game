-----------------------
first week
-The first week I started ACTUALLY learning and searching java's gaming library and it is not that bad 
-Watched some youtube videos, the visuals are horrible most of the time but the functionality is not
as bad as I imagined it would be.
-I wrote the outline of the character class
couple of tricks with the library we'll use. None of us has ever used it so I really need to learn it well
-Btw, we are communicating via whatsapp and letting each other know about how it is going.
-We also meet in the library frequently
-----------------------
second week
-The character class is kinda finalized and the character screen is formed
-we still are meeting in the library after the classes
-the library is quite confusing but I feel more confident than last week. feel like a learned a lot already
-yusuf had some fundamentals coming and enes had the maze algorithm, so I started building a road map in my mind
about the screens I must write 
-----------------------
last and week (finally ☻)
-the last week was quite busy but really fun tho. 
-I finalized several screens (Characters Screen, MainMenu, Loading Screen)
-needed to add some methods to the Characters class 
-wrote some parts of the MazeLevel class (it is a huge class and the most complex class, we all have had 
a great amount of work in that class)
-we spend a lot of time with the group and coded together in the last week mostly
