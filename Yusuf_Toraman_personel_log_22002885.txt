Personal Log:

* I have learned LibGdx library for a month with the helper online course

* I have made a simple game to learn how LibGdx works and how can we use some functionalities and properties in our game

* We made a discussion about the work distribution and project process.

* I have written the classes and functions that will create the basis and fundamental of the game and will be useful to us in the later of the project.

* We held a meeting to look at the work done according to the task distribution we had planned in the previous meeting.

* In the last 2 weeks, we have started to write code side by side as a group and move the project forward. The distribution of duties became sharper and began to be assigned about more specific events.

* In the last week, we first completed the missing screens by distributing the work, and also finished some algorithms.

* On the last day's meeting, we fixed the bugs in the game as much as possible and we also made the GUI part of the game beautiful.
